# nn-lab
***
Implementation of general neural network from scratch in pure python and numpy. 

***
## Features:
***

1.  Modular: Seperate **neuron, layer, nn** classes with their own **forward** and **backward** functions:
2.  General: NN's of any custom shape can be created
3.  Supports:
    
    *  Activations: Linear, ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax
    
    *  Loss: MSELoss, BCELoss, CrossEntropy/NLL Loss
    
    *  Optimizers: SGD, Momentum SGD, RMSprop, Adam
4.  Supports **Visualization**:
    
    *  NN layers as spatial **Transformations**
    
    *  **Decision Boundary**
    (Only layers with 2 or 3 layers are supported for visualization)
